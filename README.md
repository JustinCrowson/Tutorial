# Regex Tutorial for the few

Regular expressions are patterns used to match other character combinations in strings. 

## Summary

Today I will be going over the regex tutorial.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors are in the family that don't match any characters, for instance, the beginning of the string, or the end of a line. 

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers match a number of instances of a character, group, or character class in a string.

### OR Operator

Returns the boolean value true if either or both operands is true and returns false otherwise. However, the || operator actually returns the value of one of the specified operands, so if this operator is used with non-Boolean values, it will return a non-Boolean value.

### Character Classes

Is a set of characters enclosed within square brackets.

### Flags

Changes the default searching behavior of a regular expression. A flag is denoted using a single lowercase alphabetic character.

### Grouping and Capturing

Are a way to treat multiple characters as a single unit. 

### Bracket Expressions

Is an expression enclosed in square brackets, "[]".

### Greedy and Lazy Match

Greedy means match longest possible string, and Lazy means match shortest possible string. 

### Boundaries

The markers such as ^ and $ allow you to anchor the regex pattern to the beginning and the end of your line. 

### Back-references

Identifies a previously matched group and looks for exactly the same text again. 

### Look-ahead and Look-behind

Are zero-length assertions just like the start and end of a line, and start and end of word anchors.
